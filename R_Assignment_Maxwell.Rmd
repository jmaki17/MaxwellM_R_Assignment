This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

I began by opening the shell by going to RStudio -> Tools -> Shell.  I then copied the snp_position.txt and fang_et_al_genotypes.txt into my EEOB546_R_Assignment using

```{r}
cp snp_position.txt ../../../EEOB546_R_Assignment/
```
```{r}
cp fang_et_al_genotypes.txt ../../../EEOB545_R_Assignment/
```

While I was in the R console based command shell I used multiple commands to inspect the data sets.

Its always a good idea to check your data set before loading it onto R so I used commands in the shell to look at the file size 

```{r}
ls -lh fang_et_al_genotypes.txt 
```
```{r}
ls -lh snp_position.txt 
```

File size of fang_et_al_genotypes.txt was 11M and snp_position.txt was 81K

I also used it for inspecting the rows of data they contain
```{r}
wc -l fang_et_al_genotypes.txt 
```
```{r}
wc -l snp_position.txt
```
fang_et_al_genotypes.txt had 2783 lines and snp_positions.txt had 984 lines

Using the head command in the shell produced a large amount of text for both data sets
```{r}
head snp_position.txt
```
```{r}
head fang_et_al_genotypes.txt
```

I did not find the information produced from running the head command very helpful.
